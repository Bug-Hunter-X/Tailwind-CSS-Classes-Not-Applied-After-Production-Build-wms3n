# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applied After Production Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply after a production build.  The application works fine in development but breaks upon deployment.

## Bug Description:

Tailwind CSS classes are correctly applied during development. However, after building the application for production (e.g., using `npm run build`), the classes are not rendered, resulting in unexpected styling or no styling at all.

## Reproduction Steps:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` (development build).  Observe that styles are applied correctly.
4. Run `npm run build` (production build).
5. Serve the production build (e.g., using a simple static server).  Observe that styles are missing or incorrect.

## Potential Causes (Under Investigation):

* **Incorrect PurgeCSS configuration:**  Possible issues with how PurgeCSS removes unused CSS in the production build, potentially affecting core Tailwind directives.
* **Webpack or build tool conflicts:** Potential conflicts between the build process and how Tailwind CSS is integrated.
* **CDN or Hosting Environment:** Uncommon conflicts with how the production assets are loaded by the server. 

## Solution (See bugSolution.js):

The solution might involve careful review of the PurgeCSS configuration, ensuring all necessary Tailwind classes are included in the final production CSS.
